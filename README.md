# Let's Build a Question Generation Agent Using LangGraph!
### We will be using the Mistral 8*7B model as our LLM and use the GROQ Api to access the LLM model.

Let's build a simple agent in which the user gives a topic to the agent and the agent generates content on the topic and then generates questions based on the content generated.

This is from Satish Kumar's article written on [Medium](https://medium.com/@satish-0612/question-generation-ai-agent-using-langgraph-16571ce337f6).
